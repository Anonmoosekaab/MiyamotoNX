# How To Use
First, download this repo (either by using ```git clone``` or ```git pull``` if you've already cloned it), or by downloading a release, or by just downloading this repo as a whole.

Second, you need the filesystem for New Super Mario Bros. U. You can dump the game using ddd: https://gbatemp.net/threads/ddd-wiiu-title-dumper.418492/

Thirdly, once you have the filesystem, run ```run-python34.bat``` (or run the EXE, if you're using a release) and on first run, it should ask you to choose a folder. Choose the course_res_pack folder, or where you've stored the levels.

Enjoy.
